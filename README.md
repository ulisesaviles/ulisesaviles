# What's up! ðŸ‘‹
I am a 20 year computer science student looking to become a fullstack JS developer. I have vast experience with ReactJS, ReactNative and various Firebase services.

## I'm currently:
* Developing a system for nutritionists to provide an automated service in collaboration with Tendrish. The system has a RactNative app, a ReactJS admin portal and an API using firebase cloud functions, firebase firestore database and firebase storage.
* Developing a website for STIMB (Servicio TÃ©cnico Internacional de MÃ¡quinas Bloqueras).
* Developing a ReactNative app for Poleo (my own startup)
* Studying computer science
* Learning more technologies and improving my code skills
